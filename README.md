# US Road Construction
Analysis for a startup construction company that intends to start with an experienced, limited staff at a targeted location and looking to grow quickly. Python is used to analyze US Construction and Road Closures (2016-2021) data found on Kaggle.com merged with Airports in United States of America data found on data.world. Tableau is used to present findings.

# Objectives

The executives at the startup company expect data-driven answers and suggestions for the following questions:
  - Which state(s) have the most road construction?
  - Which state(s) have the greatest hours/job ratio?
  - Is weather a factor in construction time?

# Analysis Steps
In Jupyter Notebook scripts, the following additional steps/analyses were completed:
- Data cleaning, wrangling, and merged.
- Performed a geospatial analysis (choropleth map).
- Performed linear regression analysis by dividing data into a training and test set and analyzed model performance statistics. 
- Used cluster analysis to run the k-means algorithm to find clusters of data that corrlate to one another using numeric variables.
- Used time-series data to conduct a Dickey-Fuller test and plot autocorrelations to test for stationarity. Performed differencing to stationarize non-stationary data.
